Title: Estimating selection on synonymous codon usage and its causes using genomic data

The goals of this grant are two fold. 
First we wish to deepen our quantiative understanding of protein translation, its cost, and it's molecular processes on a genome by genome basis.
Second, we wish to use this understanding to make quantiative predictions about the average expression level of every gene within a given genome.
